# 3128-gradle-test
Team 3128's codebase being developed during the 2018 offseason. The old libraries were developed in Eclipse and deployed using WPIlib's ant script build system. In the 2019 season, the official build system will be Jaci's GradleRIO, and the official IDE will be Visual Studio Code (an Electron-based glorified text editor with enough features to allow for development but is lightweight and can run speedily on almost all machines).

To set up the build environment, follow [this guide](https://github.com/Team3128/info/wiki/Development-Environment-Setup).
